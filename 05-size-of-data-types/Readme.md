# Program to find size of diffrent data type in C

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int x;
    float f;
    char c;
    double d;
    printf("Size of int is : %d\n", sizeof(x));
    printf("Size of float is : %d\n", sizeof(f));
    printf("Size of char is : %d\n", sizeof(c));
    printf("Size of double is : %d\n", sizeof(d));
    return 0;
}
```
### Terminal Output 
```
Size of int is : 4
Size of float is : 4 
Size of char is : 1  
Size of double is : 8
```
